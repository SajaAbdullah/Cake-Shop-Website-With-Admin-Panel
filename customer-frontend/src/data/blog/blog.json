The fragrances of those times differed significantly from modern ones in that they were very concentrated and were more often intended for religious ceremonies than for cosmetic purposes. Although the same Cleopatra had her own perfume factory and left behind a recipe for a fragrance of 16 ingredients - \"kifi\". It is difficult to call it a perfume in the modern sense - it is rather a mixture of oils and herbs. Modern perfumes can have a maximum of 30% aromatic component, everything else - an alcoholic solution. But do not be upset. If you do not need such extravagant appearances as in the queen of Egypt, when he fragrances of her ships spread throughout the coast, then 100% concentrate is unlikely to be needed.",

Therefore, experts advise to apply fragrances on a clean, moisturizing body lotion.
